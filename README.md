# Sensors-with-errors
TEJ Sensors Arduino Code (with errors)

This repository contains the three source codes for TEJ students to work with Sensors - the MH, PIR and HC SR04 sensors.
The code in this repository contains errors that have been made on purpose to make the code either NOT work or work in ways that are NOT what is expected/desired.
Students will have to FIX the code in order to get it to work PROPERLY.
